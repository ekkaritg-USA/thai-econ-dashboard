 Thailand's Economic Trajectory: An Interactive Dashboard (2000-2024)

An interactive, single-page web application that visualizes and analyzes Thailand's economic trajectory from 2000-2024 against global growth benchmarks. This dashboard, built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js, links 25 years of economic data to key political events and leadership changes, revealing the profound impact of instability on the nation's growth.

## Features

* **Interactive Line Chart:** A dynamic, dual-axis line chart comparing the real GDP growth of Thailand and the World. Hover over any point to get detailed year-specific data.
* **Dynamic Information Panels:** Stat cards that update in real-time as you explore the chart, displaying the year, the serving Prime Minister(s), and the key global or domestic event for that period.
* **Annotated Timeline:** A horizontal timeline that highlights pivotal moments in Thailand's recent history (e.g., military coups, major floods, financial crises), synchronized with the main chart.
* **Thematic Analysis:** Sections that provide a deeper narrative context on the core themes identified in the data, such as the economic cost of political instability and structural vulnerabilities.
* **Responsive Design:** A clean, modern UI that is fully responsive and accessible on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Data Source

All economic growth data (Real GDP, annual % change) is sourced from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook database. Information on political leadership and key events is compiled from historical public records.

## Tech Stack

This project is built as a self-contained single-page application with no external dependencies beyond CDN-hosted libraries.

* **HTML5** for the core structure.
* **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive design.
* **Chart.js** for interactive data visualization.
* **Vanilla JavaScript** for all interactivity, DOM manipulation, and state management.
